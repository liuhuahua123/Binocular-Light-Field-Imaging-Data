# Binocular-Light-Field-Imaging-Data

This repository provides the Binocular-LF database developed in the paper __“Binocular Light-Field: Imaging Theory and Occlusion-Robust Depth Perception Application”.__

The binocular-LF database contains synthetic samples rendered by _Blender_ and real-world scenes captured by a binocular-LF system using the _Lytro Illum camera_. The number of labels is __64__. 

Furthermore, a simple synthetic scene with only three parallel planes is presented for simulation experiment. It is named __“training_16”__. The number of labels is __16__.
